### What should I do if my transdermal patch falls off?

Transdermal patches are convenient for people who cannot swallow
tablets or capsules. Patches often have less frequent dosing which can
help patients stick to their schedule. However, sometimes sweating,
bathing, or swimming can wear down the sticky adhesive. So what should
we do if the patch falls off?

**Key takeaways:**
- Most patches can be reapplied, but double-check the instructions.
- Use hydrocortisone cream if the adhesive irritates your skin.
- Always remember to rotate the application site.

_**The short answer:**_ Most of the time it’s okay to reapply a patch that
fell off. Generally, you can use tape, sticky adhesive film, or just press the
loose patch back onto the skin. Try to avoid areas like the waistline, where
tight clothing can loosen or rub off the patch.

_**The longer answer:**_ There are some exceptions to the rule. Drug
manufacturers for _Daytrana_, _Exelon_, and _Transderm Scop_ advise against
reapplying fallen patches. _Flector_ patch, a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory
drug, should only be reapplied if it was off the body for less than two hours.
_Duragesic_ or _Fentanyl_ patch should NOT be reapplied even if it were only
off for a few minutes.

**What if the adhesive irritates my skin?**

Topical steroids like hydrocortisone 1% cream (Cortizone 10) can help reduce irritation from the adhesive.
Remember to rotate the application site! Using the same area over and over again can worsen the irritation.

### What’s The Difference Between OTC and Prescription Omega-3 Fatty Acids?

Omega-3 fatty acids have many health benefits like heart, brain, and eye health.
Two important types of omega-3 fatty acids are eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA) and docosahexaenoic acid (DHA).
Fatty fish contains good amounts of omega-3 acid, and many over-the-counter (OTC) supplements are available.
There are two prescription brand-name omega-3 fatty acids called _Vascepa_ and Lovaza.
So what is the difference between OTC and prescription-strength omega-3?
Should I ask my doctor to write a prescription for omega-3 fatty acids? 

**Key takeaways:**

- _Vascepa_ and Lovaza are prescription drugs approved by the United States Food and Drug Administration (FDA).
- The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends taking omega-3 fatty oils to reduce the risk of heart disease.
- Most people consume enough omega-3 fatty oil from their diet.

**What are the differences between prescription vs OTC omega-3 fatty acids?**

Two prescription omega-3 products are available in the US: _Vascepa_ and _Lovaza_.
_Vascepa_ contains icosapent ethyl, a man-made version of EPA, while _Lovaza_ contains both EPA and DHA.
The DHA ingredient of _Lovaza_ increases the LDL cholesterol (the “bad” cholesterol) in the body.

The FDA approved these prescription medications to reduce triglyceride (TG) levels in the body.
High TG levels are linked to heart disease, heart attack, and stroke.
Very high TG levels are associated with problems in the liver and pancreas.  

Omega-3 fatty acids can reduce the TG levels in the body. Fish oils, whether from supplements or food, can lower TG levels by 20-50%.
However, it can take up to 11 servings of fish oil supplements to reach the suggested prescription strength of 2-4 grams per day.

_Vascepa_ and _Lovaza_ are regulated under FDA standards for drugs, while OTC fish oils are considered dietary supplements.
Omega-3 supplements only need to meet the FDA criteria for food products, and the actual content of DHA and EPA may be different for each brand.
To make sure there is enough omega-3 fatty acid in a fish oil supplement, try to look for brands that are USP verified.
The United States Pharmacopeia (USP) handles setting standards for dietary supplements.

The American Heart Association (AHA) recommends prescription omega-3 products to reduce triglycerides.
Make sure you talk to your doctor before taking more than 3 grams/day of omega-3 fatty acids.

**Should I ask my doctor to write a prescription for _Vascepa_ or _Lovaza_?**

_Vascepa_ is approved for use in some high-risk groups with high triglycerides levels.
Using _Vascepa_ can lower the risk of outcomes like a heart attack or stroke.
_Lovaza_, on the other hand, is not FDA approved for use with statins, a type of prescription medication for cholesterol. 
It is unknown if _Lovaza_ prevents you from having a heart attack or stroke.
But _Vascepa_ can run up to a few hundred dollars per month without insurance coverage.
_Lovaza_ is less expensive with an average price of 25-70 dollars per month. 

_Lovaza_ and _Vascepa_ can have side effects like stomach upset, nausea, and diarrhea.
_Vascepa_ may increase the risk of bleeding, especially if you are also taking a blood thinner medicine like warfarin or aspirin. 

**How do I get enough omega-3 fatty acids in my diet?**

The American Heart Association (AHA) does not recommend fish oil supplements to prevent heart disease.
Instead, the AHA recommends a healthy diet with at least two 3.5 oz servings per week of fatty fish like salmon and tuna.
Lack of omega-3 in the body can cause rough and scaly skin.
But it is very rare for a person to not have enough omega-3 in their diet.
Prescription omega-3 fatty acids should be saved for those who have very high levels of triglycerides.

### When should I get my flu shot and what type of flu shot should I get?

The CDC recommends that everyone gets his or her flu shot every year.
Especially now with COVID-19, more people are becoming aware of everyday vaccines.
Pharmacies advertise flu vaccines around August and continue to offer them until March.
Different types of flu vaccines are available, whether it be a shot or a nasal spray.
But when is the best time to receive the flu shot? And which flu vaccine is the best one?

**Key Takeaways:**

- Get your flu vaccine in the early fall to be covered for peak flu season.
- Different types of flu vaccines are available for different groups of people.
- Some people may need two flu vaccines each flu season.
- You can get the flu vaccine and the COVID vaccine at the same time.

**When should I get my flu shot?**

The CDC recommends that you get your flu shot in the early fall.
The flu season in the US can be from October to May, with most cases happening from December to March.
As it takes 2 weeks for the vaccine to work, aim to be vaccinated between September and October to get ready for the winter. 

**What are the different types of flu shots available in 2021 in the US?**

All flu shots in the 2021-2022 season are Quadrivalent, which means you are protected against four strains of flu viruses.
The shot is usually given in the upper arm. Infants between the age of 6 – 12 months old receive the shot in the thigh.
Four flu vaccines are approved for those 6 months and older: Afluria, Fluarix, FluLaval, and Fluzone.

Different flu shots are licensed for different age groups:

| **Needleless Flu Vaccines** | **Why is it Special?**        | **Key Point**                                                   | **Age**       | **Brand Names**            |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Nasal Spray  | Contains a weakened version of the flu virus | Not for people with asthma, pregnancy, or lowered immune system | For ages 2-49 | _FluMist_                  |
| Jet Injector | High-pressure jet stream instead of a needle | As effective as needle injections                               |For ages 18-64 | _AFLURIA via Jet Injector_ |

| **People 65 and Older** | **Why is it Special?**        | **Key Point**                                                   | **Age**       | **Brand Names**            |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------------:|
| High-Dose | 4x the antigen compared to the regular flu shot | Better immune response in the older population | For ages 65+ | _Fluzone High-Dose_ |
| Adjuvanted | Contains MF59, a naturally made oil emulsion | MF59 is an adjuvant, an ingredient that boosts immunity | For ages 65+ | _Fluad_ |

| **People with Egg Allergies** | **Why is it Special?**  | **Key Point**                                                   | **Age**       | **Brand Names**            |
|:------------:|:--------------------------------------------:|:---------------------------------------------------------------:|:-------------:|:--------------------------:|
| Cell-based | Made in mammal cells instead of egg protein | Potentially more effective than regular egg-based flu shots | For ages 4+ | _Flucelvax_ |
| Recombinant | Made with recombinant technology that does not need eggs | Gives better protection in people 65 years and older | For ages 18+ | _Flublok_ |


**How many flu shots should I get?**

Most people only need one flu shot for each year; some need two.
- Immunocompromised people may need two shots to cover the whole flu season. 
- Pregnant women should get flu shots early in their pregnancy.
Babies will benefit from immunity during the first few months of their lives when they are too young to be vaccinated.
- Children younger than 9 years old who have never gotten the flu vaccine are recommended to receive two flu shots four weeks apart.

**What if I have an egg allergy?**

Some flu vaccines are made with egg protein. This might be a concern to people who have egg allergies.
Egg allergies are not rare, as 1 in 80 kids and 1 in 500 adults have an allergy to eggs. But most of the time, a flu shot will not cause an allergic reaction.
Even someone who gets rashes or hives from eggs can get a flu vaccine without a problem.
If you can eat birthday cake or lightly cooked egg whites, it is safe to get a flu vaccine. As long as you do not have a life-threatening (anaphylactic) reaction to eggs, 
you can get a flu vaccine that is made with egg protein. For those with a life-threatening allergy to eggs, 
Flublok and Flucelvax are specially made flu vaccines without the egg protein.

**Is it okay to get my COVID-19 shot with the flu shot?**

Yes! When the COVID-19 vaccines were new, the CDC recommended spacing apart COVID-19 shots from other vaccines.
Now there is enough evidence to support that the vaccines will not interact with each other.
It is also okay if you choose to get your COVID-19 and flu shot on different days.
